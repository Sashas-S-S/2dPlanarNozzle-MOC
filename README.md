# 2dPlanarNozzle-MOC
This is a matlab Code for generating the contour of a Supersonic 2d Planar Nozzle using Method of Characteristics based on outlet Mach number, adiabatic index of the operational fluid and throat diameter. The wall contour generated is only for the divergent section of the nozzle assuming a centered Prandtl Meyer expansion fan at the nozzle throat. This assumption generates a minimum length divergent section contour needed for the nozzle. Based on other parameters like chamber pressure, temperature and ambient pressure, temperature other characteristics of the nozzle like thrust and expansion ratio are also calculated using analytical relations.
